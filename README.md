## Overview

This project demonstrates a fully functional rollup deployment integrated with Espresso's Decaf testnet and Arbitrum Sepolia. Our implementation leverages Espresso's fast confirmations to create a specialized L2 solution that [briefly describe your rollup's unique value proposition].

### Key Features

- ðŸš€ Fully functional rollup deployed on Espresso's Decaf testnet
- âš¡ Integrated with Espresso confirmations for enhanced security and speed
- ðŸ”„ Seamless compatibility with Arbitrum Sepolia

## Deployment Information

**CreateRollup Transaction Hash**: `0xf33d16d9449ab9624d3727726afe9f37414381cabf00fe3836101b3f3de6f176`

**Cloud Server IP Address**: `3.27.107.202`

**Chain ID / Namespace**: `898989`

## Technical Architecture

Our rollup implementation consists of the following components:

1. **Sequencer Node**: Responsible for transaction ordering and batch creation
2. **Prover Service**: Generates validity proofs for transaction batches
3. **Espresso Integration Layer**: Connects to Decaf testnet for fast confirmations
4. **Arbitrum Bridge**: Enables cross-chain communication with Arbitrum Sepolia

## Demo

A complete demonstration of our rollup's functionality can be found in our [video demo](https://youtu.be/PGIDwCzqDxs).

The demo showcases:
- Rollup initialization and connection to Espresso Decaf
- Transaction processing
- Integration with Espresso confirmations
- Proof verification
- Docker logs showing the rollup in action
